          TCP-AO Protection for BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP)
                   draft-hmntsharma-bmp-tcp-ao-latest

Abstract

   This document outlines the utilization of the TCP Authentication
   Option (TCP-AO), as specified in RFC5925, for the authentication of
   BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP) sessions, as specified in RFC7854.
   TCP-AO provides for the authentication of BMP sessions established
   between routers and BMP stations at the TCP layer.

1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Introduction

   The BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP), as specified in [RFC7854],
   recommends the use of IPsec [RFC4303] to address security
   considerations concerning the BMP session between a router and the
   BMP station managing BGP route collection.  This document suggests
   the use of the TCP Authentication Option (TCP-AO) as an
   authentication mechanism to ensure end-to-end authentication of BMP
   sessions between the routers and the BMP stations.  TCP-AO is also
   the choice of authentication for TCP-based network protocols such as
   BGP and LDP.  A comprehensive discussion of TCP-AO is provided in
   [RFC5925].

3.  TCP-AO Protection for BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP)

   The BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP), defined in [RFC7854], plays a
   crucial role in network management by allowing routers to share
   information about their BGP RIBs.  This helps operators monitor and
   troubleshoot their networks effectively.  However, the security
   considerations associated with BMP have become increasingly critical
   in light of evolving threats.  This document proposes that these
   threats be addressed by utilizing TCP-AO to safeguard BMP sessions.

   TCP-AO provides protection against spoofed TCP segments and helps
   protect the integrity of the TCP session.  Further, it provides for
   the authentication of session endpoints.  Similar to BGP, BMP can
   benefit from these security properties.

   TCP-AO helps protect the integrity of BMP session liveness at the TCP
   layer.  As outlined in Section 3.2 of [RFC7854], BMP operates as a
   unidirectional protocol, meaning no BMP messages are transmitted from
   the monitoring station to the monitored router.  BMP relies on the
   underlying TCP session, supported by TCP keepalives [RFC1122], to
   prevent session timeouts from the station to the monitored router.

3.1.  Operational Recommendations for BMP

   The implementation and use of TCP-AO to protect BMP session is
   RECOMMENDED in circumstances where the session might not otherwise be
   protected by alternative mechanisms such as IPsec.

4.  Security Considerations

   TCP-AO is not intended as a direct substitute for IPsec, nor is it
   suggested as such in this document.  The Security Considerations for
   TCP-AO in Section 11 of [RFC7854] all apply to its application for
   BMP.

   TCP-AO may inhibit connectionless resets when session keys have been
   lost or changed.  This may cause BMP sessions to linger in some
   circumstances; however, BGP shares this consideration.

   In the presence of NAT, TCP-AO requires additional support as defined
   in [RFC6978].

   TCP-AO does not provide for privacy for the BMP protocol's contents.
   When this is desired, IPsec with Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)
   can help provide for such privacy.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.

   This document is an outcome of the experiences gained through
   implementing BMP.  While TCP-AO safeguards other TCP protocols, BMP
   currently lacks the same level of protection.
